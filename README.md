## Hi there 👋 I'm Mayo!

I'm a human centered, result driven business data professional with strong technical skills in Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, and Python, combined with a business-oriented mindset that helps me analyze complex problems holistically. With 3 years of experience in project management and client success, I’ve built a strong foundation in stakeholder communication, problem-solving, and strategic execution. My mission is to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs by leveraging data analytics, AI, and process automation. 

I just completed Master’s in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive business growth, optimize operations, and support strategic decision-making.

Beyond data analytics and visualizations, I love experimenting in the kitchen, and enjoy maintaining a healthy lifestyle—both physically and mentally through fitness, mindfulness, and continuous learning. I also love exploring new places in the world!

If you're interested in data analytics, data visualizations, AI, and machine learning, let’s connect! 🚀
